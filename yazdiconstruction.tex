\section{The Yazdi Construction}

In this section we are going to use the results that we discussed above to provide a non-orientable replication of Yazdi's construction of pseudo-Anosov maps with "small stretch factors".

Yazdi provides a 5 step construction in order to produce a pseudo-Anosov map for every punctured orientable surface that has stretch factor bounded above by the desired quantity. We will reproduce each step here, giving our version of Yazdi's construction for nonorientable surfaces. 

\textbf{Step 1: Constructing the Surfaces} 

The first step in the construction is defining a family of surfaces that exhibit a sort of rotational symmetry. Using this symmetry, if one shows that a power of some homeomorphism is pseudo-Ansoov, then so was the original homeomorphism. Yazdi cites this insight as being due to Penner in his construction in \cite{penner1991bounds}. 

Note that we will try to follow Yazdi's notation as close as we can, in order to make it clear to the reader how our construction replicates his.

We will define a family of surfaces $P_{n,k}$ in the way originally done by Yazdi. Let $T$ be an orientable surface of genus 5 with 3 boundary components $c,d$ and $e$. Orient $T$ and give $c,d$ and $e$ the induced orientations from this orientation. Now add two cross-caps to $T$ but keep the boundaries of $T$ oriented. Let $p$ (respectively $q$) be a puncture (respectively a marked point) on the boundary component $e$ of $T$, with oriented arcs $r$ and $s$ connecting them on $\partial T$. See Figure X for a picture of $T$. Let $T_{i,j}$ be copies of the surface $T$, where $i,j \in \mathbb{Z}$. We will use similar notations to refer to the boundary components of $T_{i,j}$. Define the infinite surface $S_\infty$ as the quotient
$$S_\infty \coloneqq \left( \bigcup T_{i,j} \right)/\sim,$$
where $i,j \in \mathbb{Z}$. The equivalence relation $\sim$ is defined as $$c_{i,j} \sim d_{i+1,j} \hspace{1em}, \hspace{1em} r_{i,j} \sim s_{i,j+1}$$ and the gluing maps for the boundary components are by orientation-reversing homeomorphisms.

We have two natural shift maps $\overline{\rho_1},\overline{\rho_2}: T_\infty \xrightarrow[]{} T_\infty$ that act by $$\overline{\rho_1} \text{ sends } T_{i,j} \text{ to } T_{i+1,j},$$ $$\overline{\rho_2} \text{ sends } T_{i,j} \text{ to } T_{i,j+1}.$$ Note that these maps commute. Define the surface $P_{n,k}$ as the quotient of the surface $T_\infty$ by the covering action of the group generated by $(\overline{\rho_1})^n$ and $(\overline{\rho_2})^k$. Therefore, $\overline{\rho_1}$ and $\overline{\rho_2}$ induce maps on the surface $P_{n,k}$, which we denote by $\rho_1$ and $\rho_2$.

A question that naturally arises is why did we choose the surface $T$ for our building block? It comes down to two main problems:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The combinatorics of the curves make the associated matrix we get from the Penner construction satisfy the conditions of Lemma Y
    \item Having a curve $\gamma$ such that it and its image under our map form the boundary of an embedded $\mathcal{N}_3$ in our surface, which we will need in later steps (\textcolor{red}{Perhaps this was outlined above}). 
\end{enumerate}

\begin{lem}
Define the sequence
\begin{align}
    g_{n,k} &= (14k - 2)n + 2, k \geq 3, n \geq 1
\end{align}
    The genus of $P_{n,k}$ is $g_{n,k}$.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
    Consider the subsurface $U \subset P_{n,k}$ defined as $$U = \left( \bigcup_{i =0}^{k-1} T_{0,i} \right)/\sim.$$ Then $U$ is a compact, non-orientable surface of genus $12k$ with $2k$ boundary components, and forms a fundamental domain for the covering action of $\overline{\rho_1}$ on $T_\infty$. We have $$\chi(U) = 2 - 12k - 2k = 2 - 14k.$$ Thus $$\chi(P_{n,k}) = n \cdot \chi(U) = -n(14k - 2),$$ since $P_{n,k}$ is formed by gluing $n$ copies of $U$ together along circle boundary components. Therefore $$\chi(P_{n,k}) = 2 - g_{n,k} = -n(14k - 2) \implies g_{n,k} = n(14k - 2) + 2.
\end{proof}

\textbf{Step 2: Constructing the Maps}

Following Yazdi, we will now define maps $f_{n,k}: P_{n,k} \xrightarrow[]{} P_{n,k}$ that are defined as a composition of specific Dehn twists followed by a finite order mapping class. The key insight is that a power of this map will be a composition of Dehn twists that satisfy the criteria to be a Penner construction and thus pseudo-Anosov. This is how we take advantage of the rotational symmetry given to us by how the $P_{n,k}$ are constructed.

Recall that for non-orientable surfaces, we don't initially have a well-defined notion of a positive or negative Dehn twist. In order to do a Penner construction, we need to ensure that the curves we are working with are marked inconsistently. Then do Dehn twists around the curves according to these markings. Note that our labeling of the curves already gives us an inconsistent marking though. For any alpha curve $\alpha_i$, we let the marking $\phi_{\alpha_i}$ be orientation preserving and for beta curves $\beta_j$ let $\phi_{\beta_j}$ be orientation reversing. Since alpha curves only intersect beta curves (and vice versa), we have an inconsistent marking at each point of intersection.

Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the union of all $\beta$ curves except $\beta_1$ in $T_{0,0} \cup T_{0,1} \cup T_{1,0}$ (see figures below). Let $\rho_1(\mathcal{B})$ be the image of $\mathcal{B}$ under $\rho_1$. Define $\phi_b$ as the composition of Dehn twists along all the curves in the set $\overline{\mathcal{B}} \coloneqq \mathcal{B} \cup \rho_1(\mathcal{B}) \cup \dots \cup \rho_1^{n-1}(\mathcal{B})$. Since the curves in $\overline{\mathcal{B}}$ are disjoint, Dehn twists along them commute. Therefore, it is not necessary to specify the order in which we compose these Dehn twists in $\phi_b$. Let $\mathcal{R}$ be the union of all $\alpha$ curves except $\alpha_1$ in $T_{0,0}$. Define $\mathcal{R}$ and $\phi_r$ in the exact same way.

Let $\alpha_1,\beta_1 \subset T_{0,0}$ be the curves in Figure Z. Let $\phi$ be the composition of Dehn twists along all the curves $\alpha_1, \rho_1(\alpha_1), \dots, \rho_1^{n-1}(\alpha_1)$ followed by Dehn twists along all the curves $\beta_1,\rho_1(\beta_1),\dots,\rho_1^{n-1}(\beta_1)$. Define
\begin{align*}
    f_{n,k} &\coloneqq \rho_2 \circ \phi \circ \phi_b \circ \phi_r 
\end{align*}
We are using the same notation as Yazdi, so the composition is from right to left. It follows from the Penner construction that $(f_{n,k})^k$ is pseudo-Anosov. Hence $f_{n,k}$ itself is pseudo-Anosov and invariant train tracks $\tau^1_{n,k}$ for $f_{n,k}$ can be obtained from Penner's construction that we described above. 

\textbf{Step 3: The Mapping Torus}

We have now constructed an infinite family of non-orientable surfaces and pseudo-Anosov maps, but there's an alarming issue with it. Looking back at Lemma Z, the genera of this family of surfaces does not encapsulate every positive integer. We are going to use our extension of the Thurston norm to "fill in the gaps", by constructing fibers for fibrations of the mapping tori of the pseudo-Anosov maps we defined above.

Let $M_{n,k}$ be the mapping torus of $f_{n,k}$ .Likewise, let $\widetilde{M_{n,k}}$ denote the mapping tori of $\widetilde{f_{n,k}}$, where $\widetilde{f_{n,k}}$ is the orientation preserving lift of $f_{n,k}$ to the orientation double cover of $P_{n,k}$. Note that it follows that $\widetilde{M_{n,k}}$ is the orientation double cover of $M_{n,k}$.

Let $C_{n,k}$ denote the fibered face of $H_2(\widetilde{M_{n,k}},\mathbb{R})$ corresponding to the map $\widetilde{f_{n,k}}$. We will show that $M_{n,k}$ contains a closed non-orientable surface of genus 3 that lifts to a closed orientable surface of genus 2 in $\widetilde{M_{n,k}}$ that is contained in the closure of $C_{n,k}$.

\textcolor{red}{Will come back to this section later, first I need to go and do the oriented sum}

\begin{lem}
There is a non-trivial homology classes $0 \neq [\widetilde{F_{n,k}}] \in H_2(\widetilde{M_{n,k}};\mathbb{Z})$ represented by orientable surfaces of genus two that is a lift of a non-orientable surfaces of genus three $F_{n,k}$ in $M_{n,k}$. Moreover, $\widetilde{F_{n,k}}$ is Thurston norm-minimizing and lie in the closures $\overline{\mathcal{C}_{n,k}}$.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}

\end{proof}

\begin{lem}
Let $\iota: \widetilde{M_{n,k}} \xrightarrow[]{} \widetilde{M_{n,k}}$ denote the deck transformation that generates the deck group of the orientation double cover. Likewise, let $\iota_*: H_2(\widetilde{M_{n,k}};\mathbb{R}) \xrightarrow[]{} H_2(\widetilde{M_{n,k}};\mathbb{R})$ denote its action on second homology. Then $\iota_*([\wt{F_{n,k}}]) = -[\wt{F_{n,k}}]$.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}

By the way we have defined $\wt{F_{n,k}}$ as a lift of an embedded subsurface in $M_{n,k}$, we know that $\iota$ sends $\wt{F_{n,k}}$ to itself. We want to see that $\iota$ is also orientation reversing when restricted to $\wt{F_{n,k}}$.

To begin, we first need to see what our surface $\wt{F_{n,k}}$ looks like embedded in $\wt{M_{n,k}}$. Recall the way that $F_{n,k}$ is defined as an embedded $\mathcal{N}_1$ with two boundary components, $\gamma$ and $f^k(\gamma) = \hat{\gamma}$ in one of the fibers of $M_{n,k}$ union the tubes formed by following $\gamma$ $k$ times around the suspension flow in $M_{n,k}$. Let's observe what happens to our embedded genus 1 with 2 boundary components in a single fiber after it is lifted to the orientation double cover. The orientation double cover of a genus 1 nonorientable surface is $S^2$, and we can see here that our embedded surface will lift to a sphere with four boundary components, one can see this by imagining two copies of our embedded subsurface being glued along their single cross-cap. For ease of notation, let's denote the two lifts of $\gamma$ and $\hat{\gamma}$ as $\gamma_0,\gamma_1$ and $\hat{\gamma}_0,\hat{\gamma}_1$ respectively. These curves form the boundary of the sphere with four boundary components that is sitting in our single fiber in $\wt{M_{n,k}}$. 

Recall that $\wt{M_{n,k}}$ is not only the double orientation cover of $M_{n,k}$, but is also the mapping torus of $\wt{f_{n,k}}$. Looking at these maps, if we let $p$ denote the covering map for $\wt{P_{n,k}} \xrightarrow[]{} P_{n,k}$, then we know that $p \circ \wt{f_{n,k}} = f_{n,k} \circ p$. This tells us that $\wt{f_{n,k}}$ sends $\gamma_0$ to $\hat{\gamma_0}$ and $\gamma_1$ to $\hat{\gamma}_1$. Thus we can see that the tube traced out by following the suspension flow of $\gamma$ to $\hat{\gamma}$ gets lifted to tubes following the suspension flow of $\gamma_0$ to $\hat{\gamma_0)}$ and $\gamma_1$ to $\hat{\gamma_1}$. These tubes glued to our sphere with four boundary components give us our genus 2 surface in the cover. 

We will now show that $\iota$ restricted to $\wt{F_{n,k}}$ is orientation reversing by showing that it is orientation reversing on the individual components, i.e. the sphere with boundary and the two tubes. First note that the boundary components of the of the sphere with boundary are also curves that lie in one of the fibers of $\wt{M_{n,k}}$. Suppose that we give an orientation to our fiber which induces orientations on our curves. Since $\iota$ is orientation reversing on the fiber, it must reverse the orientation of our curves, and thus reverses the orientations of the boundaries of our sphere when we restrict $\iota$. Thus $\iota$ must be orientation reversing on the whole of the sphere with boundary components. \textcolor{red}{I know you made a slightly different argument for tubes Sayantan, but we can't we just use the same exact arguement for the tubes since the tubes are bounded by these curves?}

Now that we know that $\iota$ is orientation reversing on $\wt{F_{n,k}}$, we know that $\iota_*: H_2(\wt{F_{n,k}}) \xrightarrow{} \wt{F^i_{n,k}}$ acts by sending the fundamental class $[\wt{F_{n,k}}]$ to its negative. We also know that $\wt{F_{n,k}}$ is viewed as a representative for an element of $H_2(\wt{M_{n,k}})$ by the image of $[\wt{F_{n,k}}] \in H_2(\wt{F_{n,k}})$ under the map on second homology induced by the inclusion $i: \wt{F_{n,k}} \xrightarrow[]{} \wt{M_{n,k}}$. Since $\iota$ can be restricted to $\wt{F_{n,k}}$, it is a map of the pair $(\wt{M_{n,k}},\wt{F_{n,k}})$ and thus by the naturality of the long exact sequence of a pair, $\iota_*$ and $i_*$ commute. This tells us that $\iota_*: H^2(\wt{M_{n,k}}) \xrightarrow[]{} H^2(\wt{M_{n,k}})$ acts by $\iota_*([\wt{F_{n,k}}]) = -[\wt{F_{n,k}}]$, giving us our desired result.
\end{proof}

\textbf{Step 4: Bounding the Stretch Factor} 

In \cite{yazdi2018pseudo}, Yazdi shows that the family of pseudo-Anosov maps that we have constructed all have the log of their stretch factor bounded above by a similar factor. He does this by considering the associated matrix that comes along with a pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism and showing based on the combinatorics of the curves of the constructed examples, that the spectral radius is bounded by Lemma 1. We want to prove the same thing for our families of examples. Namely that if we let $\lambda_{n,k}$ be the stretch factor of $f_{n,k}$, then we have the following lemma: 

\begin{lem}
There exists a universal positive constants $C'$ and such that for every $n \geq 1$ and $k \geq 3$:
$$\log(\lambda_{n,k}) \leq C'\frac{n}{g_{n,k}}$$
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
We have purposefully constructed our examples so our curves are in the same "general form" as Yazdi's were and thus they will still satisfy the criteria of Lemma 1. Though we still want to explicitly show that this is the case.

We will first show that this is true for $f_{n,k}$ and the curves on $P_{n,k}$. First for consistency of notation, let
$$\mathcal{A} \coloneqq \mathcal{B} \cup \mathcal{R} \cup \{\alpha_1,\beta_1\}, \overline{\mathcal{A}} \coloneqq \mathcal{A} \cup \rho_1(\mathcal{A}) \cup \dots \cup \rho_1^{n-1}(\mathcal{A})$$
$$\hat{\mathcal{A}} \coloneqq \overline{\mathcal{A}} \cup \rho_2(\overline{\mathcal{A}}) \cup \dots \cup \rho_2^{k-1}(\overline{\mathcal{A}})$$. Thus $\hat{\mathcal{A}}$ is all the curves on our surface we are Dehn twisting around to get $f_{n,k}$. 

Recall from above that we stated we need to find the eigenvalue of the matrix that represents the action of $f_{n,k}$ on the subspace of the cone of transverse measures that is spanned by the measures assigning $1$ to connected curves in $\hat{\mathcal{A}}$ and 0 to everything else. Let $A$ be said matrix and $\gamma$ the adjacency graph of $A$. In order to bound the spectral radius of $A$, we need to show that $\gamma$ satisfies the criteria of Lemma 1. To do this we first need to partition the vertices of $\gamma$, which is equivalent to a partition of the curves in $\hat{\mathcal{A}}$: $$\mathcal{A} = \bigcup_{i=1}^k \rho_2^{i-2}(\overline{\mathcal{A}}).$$ Then define $V_i$ for $1 \leq i \leq k$ as the vertices of $\gamma$ corresponding to elements in $\rho_2^{i-2}(\overline{\mathcal{A}})$.

We can now check the conditions of Lemma 1, based on the combinatorics of the curves on our surface:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item 
    \item 
    \item 
    \item 
    \item All the curves corresponding to an element of $V_j$, $3 < j \leq k$ are disjoint from all the curves in $\overline{A}$. Thus $f_{n,k}$ and $h_{n,k}$ just act by rotation
\end{enumerate}

Setting $\lambda = \lambda_{n,k}$, Lemma \textcolor{red}{Spectral Radius} implies that 
$$\lambda^{k-1} = \rho(A)^{k-1} = \rho(A^{k-1}) \leq 4D^4 \implies (k-1)\cdot \log(\lambda) \leq \log(4D^4)$$ $$\implies \frac{k}{2}\log(\lambda) \leq (k-1)\log(\lambda) \leq \log(4D^4)$$

On the other hand, we know $g_{n,k} = (14k - 2)n + 2 \leq 14kn$. Therefore
$$\log(\lambda) \leq 2\log(4D^4)\cdot\frac{1}{k} \leq 2\log(4D^4)\cdot \frac{14n}{g_{n,k}} = C'\frac{n}{g_{n,k}}$$ where $C' \coloneqq 28\log(4D^4)$
\end{proof}

\textbf{Step 5: Filling in the Gaps}

Recall that $\wt{P_{n,k}}$ is the double orientation covers of $P_{n,k}$ and also the fibers of $\wt{M_{n,k}}$. As in Yazdi, we are going to be considering the homology classes $[\wt{P^r_{n,k}}] \coloneqq [\wt{P_{n,k}}] + r[\wt{F_{n,k}}]$. Representatives for these homology classes can be found by taking the oriented sum.

At this point we should be able to cite Yazdi's Lemma 3.5 as the proof will go the exact same and say:

\begin{lem}
The surfaces $\wt{P^r_{n,k}}$ are Thurston norm-minimizing, with genera equal to $\wt{g^r_{n,k}} \coloneqq g_{n,k} + r - 1$. As $r$ varies between $0$ and $14n$, the genera of $\wt{P^r_{n,k}}$ cover the range between $\wt{g_{n,k}}$ and $\wt{g_{n,k+1}}$. Moreover, $\wt{P^r_{n,k}}$ are fibers of fibrations of $\wt{M_{n,k}}$ with pseudo-Anosov monodromy that fixes $4n$ of the singularities of the invariant foliation and descend to fibrations of $M_{n,k}$.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
    \textcolor{red}{For now I'm going to write this section as if the oriented sum section above didn't exist, because I'm not sure how I want to structure that section yet.}
    All statements of this lemma except for the last follow in the same way as Lemma 3.5 in \cite{yazdi2018pseudo}. We know that 
    $$\chi(\wt{P^r_{n,k}}) = \chi(\wt{P_{n,k}}) + r\cdot\chi(\wt{F_{n,k}}) = (-2(g_{n,k} - 1) + 2)-2r = -2(g_{n,k} + r - 1) + 2.$$ This proves the identity for the genus of $\wt{P^r_{n,k}}.$ To see that $\wt{P^r_{n,k}}$ is Thurston norm-minimizing, note that $[\wt{P^r_{n,k}}] \subset C_{n,k}$ due to $P_{n,k} \subset C_{n,k}$ and $F_{n,k} \subset \overline{C_{n,k}}$. Note that from Theorem 3 in \cite{thurston1986norm}, one can deduce that the fiber of a fibration of a 3-manifold is Thurston norm-minimizing in its second homology class. This along with Lemma\textcolor{red}{F is minimizing} and the linearity of the Thurston norm on a fibered faace tells us
    $$x([\wt{P^r_{n,k}}]) = x([\wt{P_{n,k}}]) + rx([\wt{F_{n,k}}]) = \chi_-(\wt{P_{n,k}}) + 2r = 2(g_{n,k} + r - 1) - 2$$ so $\wt{P^r_{n,k}}$ is also norm minimizing.
    
    Just as Yazdi says, the homology class $[\wt{P^r_{n,k}}] = [P_{n,k}] + r[F_{n,k}]$ is clearly integral. It is also primitive since there is a curve in $\wt{M_{n,k}}$ that intersects $P_{n,k}$ transversely and exactly once, while avoiding $F_{n,k}$. (?). Since $[P^r_{n,k}]$ is integral, primitive and lies in the fibered face $C_{n,k}$, by Theorem X it is the fiber of a fibration of $\wt{M_{n,k}}$. Since the monodromy $\wt{f_{n,k}}$ is pseudo-Anosov, all monodromies that correspond to this face are pseudo-Anosov \textcolor{red}{CITE}, so in particular $\wt{f^r_{n,k}}$ is pseudo-Anosov. 
    
    As we see in Yazdi, the singularities of the stable foliation of $f_{n,k}$ that are fixed are the $2n$ intersection points of the axis of $\rho_1$ with $P_{n,k}$. Thus $\wt{f_{n,k}}$ has $4n$ singularities of its stable foliation. Furthermore we have already seen that the surface $\F_{n,k}$ can be isotoped to be transverse to the suspension flow and disjoint from the orbit of the $2n$ singularities of $f_{n,k}$, thus $\wt{F_{n,k}}$ can be isotoped to be disjoint from the orbit of these $4n$ singularities of $\wt{f_{n,k}}$. Thus the monodromy $\wt{f^r_{n,k}}$ still fixes the corresponding $4n$ singularities on $P^r_{n,k}$. 
    
    This all suffices for the orietable case, but for the non-orientable case we need to also show that our fibrations of $\wt{M_{n,k}}$ defined by our maps $\wt{f^r_{n,k}}$ and surfaces $P^r_{n,k}$ descend to fibrations on $M_{n,k}$. Recall that Lemma 3 gave us the exact criteria for a fibration of $\wt{M_{n,k}}$ to descend to a fibration of $M_{n,k}$. It is precisely when the corresponding 1-form $\wt{\alpha}$ is the pullback of a 1-form on $M_{n,k}$ and the integral $\int_{x_0}^{\iota(x_0)} \alpha \in \mathbb{Z}$ for some chosen basepoint $x_0 \in \wt{M_{n,k}}$. For our situation, this corresponding 1-form is exactly the Poincar\'e dual of $[P^r_{n,k}]$, which we will denote $\wt{\alpha}$. Since $[\wt{P^r_{n,k}}] = [\wt{P_{n,k}}] + r\cdot[\wt{F_{n,k}}]$ and both of the latter homology classes come from lifting surfaces in $M$, we know that $\wt{\alpha}$ satisifes both of these conditions by Lemmas 4 and 7.. 
\end{proof}

We can now prove our version of Yazdi's Lemma 3.6:

\begin{lem}
There exists a constant $C > 0$ such that for every $n \geq 1$, $k \geq 3$, and $0 \leq r \leq 6n$ we have $$\log(\lambda^r_{n,k}) \leq C\frac{n}{\wt{g^r_{n,k}}}$$
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
    Let $\mathcal{C} = \wt{\mathcal{C}^i_{n,k}}$ be our fibered faces and $h: \mathcal{C} \xrightarrow[]{} \mathbb{R}$ the function described in Theorem X. Note that we have 
    $$\wt{g^r_{n,k}} = \wt{g_{n,k}} + r \leq \wt{g_{n,k}} + 14n < 2\wt{g_{n,k}} < 2g_{n,k}$$
    Thus
    $$h([\wt{P^r_{n,k}}]) < h([\wt{P_{n,k}}]) \leq C'\frac{n}{g_{n,k}} \leq 2C'\frac{n}{\wt{g^r_{n,k}}} $$
\end{proof}

So now we have that our surfaces $\wt{P^r_{n,k}}$ are fibers of fibrations of $\wt{M_{n,k}}$ that descend to fibrations of $M_{n,k}$ and their monodromies are pseudo-Anosov with their stretch factors bounded. The pseudo-Anosov monodromies $\wt{f^r_{n,k}}$ descend to pseudo-Anosov monodromies on $M_{n,k}$ with the same stretch factor. Thus our upper bound of $2C'\frac{n}{\wt{g^{r}_{n,k}}}$ still holds, but we do need to make a slight modification. This bound is in terms of $\wt{g^r_{n,k}}$, the genus on the fiber in the double orientation cover, but the genus of our fiber downstairs will be one greater, thus $2C'\frac{n}{\wt{g^r_{n,k}}} = 2C'\frac{n}{g^r_{n,k} - 1} \leq 2C'\frac{n}{\frac{1}{2}g^r_{n,k}} = 4C'\frac{n}{g^r_{n,k}}$.

We can now think of $f^r_{n,k}$ as a map on a non-orientable surface of genus $g^r_{n,k}$. Note from above we know that $g^r_{n,k}$ covers all natural numbers between $g_{n,k}$ and $g_{n,k+1}$, thus this set of genera for all $r$ covers all natural numbers larger than $g_{n,3} = 40n + 2$. Recall that all of these surfaces will have $2n$ singularities, so we can either puncture $n$ or $n + 1$ to account for all possible number of punctures.

We can now give a proof of the first half of Theorem 9:

\begin{thm}[Theorem 9.1]
For any fixed $n \in \mathbb{N}$, there are positive constants $B_1' = B_1'(n)$ and $B_2' = B_2'(n)$ such that for any $g \geq 2$
$$\frac{B_1'}{g} \leq l'_{g,n} \leq \frac{B_2'}{g}$$
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
    ~
    We begin by proving the upper bound. By Lemma 18 and above, we have that there exists a number $C' > 0$ such that for $g \geq 40n + 2$, $l'_{g,n} \leq 4C'\frac{n}{g}$. So we take $B_2(n)$ to be:
    $$B_2(n) = \max{4C'n, l'_{1,n}, 2l'_{2,n}, \dots, (40n + 1)l'_{40n+1,n}}$$
    For the lower bound, first recall that the lift of any pseudo-Anosov on a non-orientable surface $N_{g,n}$ to the double cover $S_{g-1,2n}$ is still pseudo-Anosov with the same stretch factor. Thus any lower bound on $l_{g-1,2n}$ is a lower bound for $l'_{g,n}$. In \cite{penner1991bounds}, Penner proved that
    $$l_{g,n} \geq \frac{\log(2)}{12g - 12 + 4n}$$
    And thus $$l'_{g,n} \geq l_{g-1,2n} \geq \frac{log(2)}{12g - 24 + 8n} > \frac{\log(2)}{12ng}$$
    And so like Yazdi, we can set $B_2'(n) = \frac{\log(2)}{12n}$
\end{proof}
