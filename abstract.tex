  We generalize Thurston norm and the related theory of fibered faces to the setting of non-orientable
  $3$-manifolds. This lets us construct examples of pseudo-Anosov maps on non-orientable surfaces with small
  stretch factors. Using this, we prove that for a fixed number of punctures, the minimal stretch factor of a
  genus $g$ non-orientable surface behaves like $\frac{1}{g}$, generalizing the techniques and a result of
  Yazdi.
