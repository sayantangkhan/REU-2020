We prove that for non-orientable surface the minimal stretch factor of a pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism of a surface of genus $g$ with a fixed number of punctures is asympototically on the order of $\frac{1}{g}$.  Our result adapts the work of Yazdi to non-orientable surfaces.  We include the details of Thurston's theory of fibered faces for non-orientable 3-manifolds.
 % We generalize Thurston norm and the related theory of fibered faces to the setting of non-orientable $3$-manifolds. This lets us construct examples of pseudo-Anosov maps on non-orientable surfaces with small stretch factors. Using this, we prove that for a fixed number of punctures, the minimal stretch factor of a genus $g$ non-orientable surface behaves like $\frac{1}{g}$, generalizing the techniques and a result of Yazdi.
