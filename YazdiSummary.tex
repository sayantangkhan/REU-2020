\section{Extending Yazdi (Different Version)}

\textcolor{red}{I wanted to give a different more summarized version of Yazdi's construction if we decide to frame it as this is a possible application of our results on how to extend the Thurston Norm.}

The main application of our results on extending the Thurston norm that motivated this project is extending the work in \cite{yazdi2018pseudo} on the minimal stretch factor of pseudo-Anosov homeomorphisms. Yazdi builds on the work of Penner in studying the behavior of the function $l_{g,n}$ along rays of constant $n$ in the $(g,n)$ plane. In this paper Yazdi proves the following theorems:

\begin{thm}
For any fixed $n \in \mathbb{N}$, there are positive constants $B_1 = B_1(n)$ and $B_2 = B_2(n)$ such that for any $g \geq 2$
$$\frac{B_1}{g} \leq l_{g,n} \leq \frac{B_2}{g}.$$
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}
There exist positive constants $A$, $B$ and $C$ such that for any $n \geq 1$ and $g \geq Cn\log^2(n)$ we have $$\frac{B}{g} \leq l_{g,n} \leq \frac{A}{g}$$.
\end{thm}

Using our results on the Thurston norm and fibrations over $S^1$ for non-orientable 3-manifolds, we will provide an extension of Yazdi's work, namely that both of these theorems hold in the non-orientable case as well, albeit with different constants. The full details of Yazdi's original proof and construction can be found in \cite{yazdi2018pseudo}.

\textcolor{red}{I think what I've written above could be used as part of a possible introduction to the section on Yazdi. What I was going to put below but I now realize will be good to put above the steps we are outlining above, is an outline of all of Yazdi's steps and how we are modifying it for our purposes}.
